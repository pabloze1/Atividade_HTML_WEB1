        <p> Aran was a powerful warrior who possessed a polearm with a spirit, Maha, 
            which she obtained from a legendary blacksmith in Mu Lung. As weapons with 
            spirits were extremely rare, and even rarer still was it to be deemed worthy 
            to wield one, it spoke immensely of Aran's strength as a legendary warrior. 
            Having grown up with a stoic grandfather, Aran developed a quiet, serious 
            personality. She also rode a powerful Silver Wolf named Ryko into battle.</p>
